This project is mainly about creating a search bar to search for star war characters. I also added that we’ll have Star Wars characters’ list on the right as a sidebar and will be able to see the character details not only by searching the name but also scrolling down this list, pressing on the wanted person and the same details will be shown. The main details like name, race, birth year will be shown and the additional details will be shown when pressing on the additional buttons. If a person does not have something though like a vehicle it will not be shown in the additional buttons. 
The code also sometimes is a little slow and needs a little time to load additional details as it needs a little time to fetch these details from swapi and has many async methods.
The code has several 2 main files: src and public. 
In the public file we have the main site logo and public.js in which we write how to display the given photo and the name of the site.
•	App.js:  This is the core file where everything comes together. It fetches the character data from the Star Wars API (SWAPI) using a custom `fetchCharacters` function, which populates a list of all characters. It manages the overall structure of the app, including rendering the `SearchBar`, `CharacterList`, and `CharacterDetails` components. State is used to track the characters, selected character, loading state, and any errors during data fetching. It also contains logic to handle character selection from the list or search results.
   
•	CharacterDetails.js: CharacterDetails is responsible for displaying detailed information about a selected character. It has a `state` that holds the additional details (like films, species, starships, and vehicles) and whether these details are currently visible or hidden. It includes functions for fetching the additional details from SWAPI and toggling the visibility of these details when the user clicks the respective buttons. The component resets its state whenever a new character is selected to ensure only the current character's information is displayed.
   
•	CharacterList.js: This component receives the list of characters as props and renders it as a clickable list. When a user clicks on a character, the selected character's details are displayed in the main content area.
   
•	SearchBar.js: search bar allows users to filter the list of characters by name. It uses a form with an input field, and when the user submits the form, the search query is passed up to the parent component to filter the character list and display the matching character.
   
•	App.css: This CSS file defines the layout and styling of the application. It uses flexbox for structuring the main content and sidebar, and includes styles for the character list, details view, and search bar. Additionally, it provides custom styles for the buttons that show or hide additional character details, and ensures a visually appealing experience with background images, text colors, and other UI elements【7†source】.

•	Index.html: This is the default entry point for React apps, where the root `div` is defined for the app to render into. It remains unchanged from the standard React template.
When working on this project I used Visual Studio Code. To run the application, use the terminal command “npm start”. This will launch the development server and open the application in a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome), allowing you to search for Star Wars characters and view their details interactively.
